### Motivation
Have you ever experienced a time when you were certain that you needed or wanted a getaway but simply can’t think of a single travel destination that suits your needs or the mood? As a travel maniac myself, I most definitely have had a lot of those moments, stuck only with the idea of a getaway but without any concrete idea on where to go, full of motivation but without any inspirations. It is those moments that motivated me to design and create this product that is `어디든`, the perfect brainstorming tool for aspiring travelers, all who needs is some inspiration.

### Why did you build 어디든?
어디든 is built for anyone who has the motivation to travel but doesn’t have the inspiration for travel.

### What kind of problems does or can 어디든 solve?
